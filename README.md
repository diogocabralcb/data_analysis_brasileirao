A simple data source download and analysis automation script

This script automatically downloads a .csv file located on an online drive. I used the pyautogui module's mouse and keyboard automation to download a file with data from the Brazilian Championship from 2003 to 2019. From this data source, some indicators and some visualizations are automatically generated.
